1)  List out 5 files in your system which consuming most of the disk space

      du -ah | sort -n -r | head -n 5
             
               or

      du -sh  | sort -n -r | head -n 5

       
  to get list of files with maximum depth under particular partition

       
     du -ah --max-depth=3 /home | sort -n -r | head -n 


         du command: Estimate file space usage.
	-h : Print sizes in human-readable format (e.g., 10MB).
	-S : Do not include the size of subdirectories.
	-s : Display only a total for each argument.
	sort command : sort lines of text files.
	-r : Reverse the result of comparisons.
	-h : Compare human readable numbers (e.g., 2K, 1G).
	head : Output the first part of files.
	maxdepth levels : Descend at most levels (a non-negative integer) of directories below the starting-points. -maxdepth means 				apply the tests and actions from the starting-points.

2) Create one common folder in such way that anyone can create files inside that independently and should not be able to delete other users files from that common folder.
	
		 -mkdir directory/
  	 
	To create a directory we use mkdir command
    	
	  	 -chmod 1777 directory/

       The chmod (short for change mode) command is used to manage file system access permissions on Unix and Unix-like systems. There are three 		basic file system permissions, or modes, to files and directories: read (r) write (w).
       
           u -users, g- group, o - others

             4 - used to read
	     2 - used to write
	     1 - used to execute
    
        combining all (4+2+1) = 7 

     So, 777 means users, group and others can execute, read and write files. 
     
     sticky bit(t) here we use sticky bit 

     It is a permission bit where only owner can delete files or rename files. Others cannot have access to  delete other user files.
 
     Adding 1 to 777 (1777) means only root user or owner can delete files in directory.

3) Create user name "shubham" and add that user in the group "adm"
      a) Create folder /data , change owner and group as  "root:adm
      b) Change /data permission such a way that user can able to write data in this folder and ownership of files or folder which you creates in 	 this folder should be same as parent folder i.e /data folder permission (root:adm)


      to create user  

     -sudo useradd user_name
     -sudo useradd pavani

      to create group 

     -sudo groupadd group_name
     -sudo groupadd adm


      To add user to the group

       -sudo useradd -G group_name user_name
       -sudo useradd -G adm pavani

a) 

      Change the Owner and Group of a File

	To change both the owner and the group of a file use the chown command followed by the new owner and group separated by a colon (:) with 		no intervening spaces and the target file.

       
      -chown [OPTIONS] USER:GROUP FILE(s)

	chown command changes user ownership of a file, directory, or link in Linux

	[OPTIONS] – the command can be used with or without additional options.
	[USER] – the username or the numeric user ID of the new owner of a file.
	[:] – use the colon when changing a group of a file.
	[GROUP] – changing the group ownership of a file is optional.
	FILE – the target file.


b)
        -chmod permissions filename       

        -chmod 664 test.txt

        </data>#
        rw_rw_r  root adm test.txt
 

	r = read permission
	w = write permission
	x = execute permission
	– = no permission

       chmod command(change mode) is use to manage file access permissions.Changing the file mode bits according to respective mode

       rw-rw-r-- means 664
   
           -user and group can read and write but cant execute.
           
           -others can read only.
